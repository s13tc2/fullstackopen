1. Store the initial state of the application in the file db.json, which should be placed in the root of the project.
2. The API https://restcountries.com provides data for different countries in a machine-readable format, a so-called REST API. Create an application, in which one can look at data of various countries. The application should probably get the data from the endpoint all.
3. Improve on the application in the previous exercise, such that when the names of multiple countries are shown on the page there is a button next to the name of the country, which when pressed shows the view for that country.
4. Add to the view showing the data of a single country, the weather report for the capital of that country. There are dozens of providers for weather data. One suggested API is https://openweathermap.org.
